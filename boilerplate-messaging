## Section 2: Boilerplate Messaging
The goal here is to get approved wording that you can use when you are creating marketing or sales material. This will help you stay consistent in your messages and make sure you arenâ€™t re-creating this text every time you create a new campaign. 

### The One-Liner
This is a one or two sentence description of what you do. It should focus on what you are and the greatest benefit you deliver. Bonus points for giving a hint about who you are for.

### The One-Paragraph Elevator Pitch
A 1 paragraph description of what you are, the top one or two value points you deliver and some indication of what your target market is. Bonus points for indicating some proof you can deliver the value you say you can.

### The 100 Word Description
This is usually one to two paragraphs. Here you have room to include what you are, your top 2 to 3 value points, an indication of proof you can deliver that value, and something that indicates what your target market is.

### The 500 Word Description
This is usually one to 4 to 5 paragraphs. Here you have room to include what you are, a longer description of your top 3 to 4 value points, proof you can deliver that value, and something that indicates what your target market is. In this longer form you can also include additional general proof of market position and/or traction which would include names of customers, brag-worthy statistics (number of users, usage metrics, etc but only if they are clearly exceptional and understandable), awards won, etc.
