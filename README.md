# product-positioning-template
A template for a product positioning &amp; messaging workshop orginally created by [April Dunford](https://aprildunford.com/)

## What is this and why do I want to use it?
The messaging document is a way to keep a record of the current company thinking on positioning and target markets, as well as a set of boilerplate messages that have been edited, massaged and approved, that can be used and reused to keep your messaging consistent. There are other ways to track this of course (in a shared folder for example). I prefer to keep save this in version control so that I can easily track changes, and so people can fork the repo for their own use. 

The messaging document becomes:
* The consistent record of the current approved company Positioning that provides context for all marketing and sales content creation.
* A set of all approved marketing boilerplate messages that can be used without further review and approval.
* A set of approved marketing boilerplate messages that can be used as the foundation for any specializes one-off marketing or sales messages. 

**Assumptions:** This template assumes that the company has only a single product and that the company and product positioning are equivalent. this template is built with a B2B startup in mind.
